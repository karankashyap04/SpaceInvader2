# SpaceInvader2

This is the second version of a project in which I started to learn the basics of game development using the framework PyGame.
The code here is a modified (I tried to improve it) version of a beginners PyGame tutorial shared by FreeCodeCamp, which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/FfWpgLFMI7w). 

<b>The major changes I made to the code were:</b>
* Changes to player movement code for a better user experience with respect to spaceship dynamics (I felt that there were some logical inaccuracies in the original code)
* The introduction of a level-based system, wherein the number of enemies and the speed of their movement increases as you progress in the game and reach higher levels

Since this was the first time I was using PyGame, I added many comments to my code (to help me remember the logic and syntax), as a result of which it does not look very clean in some parts. Subsequent projects I work on using PyGame will definitely look cleaner and have more efficiently designed code.
